# Example 1
# Say you have a button board BPW5007 plugged into wing AL look at a pin in
# the "Button" column, say LED4 then across to column AL and you can see it
# corresponds to FPGA pin P18, if the same board was plugged into BH then
# LED4 would be P58

# Example 2
# If you have a VGA board BPW5017 plugged into wing CH, then look at a pin
# under the VGA8 column, say BLU and across to column CH and you find that
# BLU is FPGA pin P10, if the same VGA board was plugged into wing AH then
# BLU would be FPGA pin P65

# Once you find the FPGA pin, go to the NET definition below and uncomment
# the respective line. You may rename the NET from WingX_Ynn to the name you
# use in your design
